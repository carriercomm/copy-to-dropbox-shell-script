This is a quick hack that isn't perfect but gets the job done for now.

The easiest (but probably not least painful) way to use it is to use Automator to add a service in Automator that uses "Get Selected Finder Items" and then runs the script.
This will be changed sometime...

Also, the script works, but is unfinished so it doesn't support files with spaces in the filename.
